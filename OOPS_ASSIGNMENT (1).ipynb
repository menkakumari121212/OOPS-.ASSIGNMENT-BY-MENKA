The objects will each have properties and methods for example, a book might have properties such as a title, author, andpublished date, while a member has methods such as the ability to borrow and return books.\n",

        "• Classes are sort of like blueprints or templates for code in the production of objects.\n",

        "• Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in OOPs that work together to create well-structured and maintainable code. While they are often used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings.\n",
        "\n",
        "• **Abstraction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "– Abstraction focuses on hiding implementation details aims at delivering only the minimum amount of functionality to ease the user's interaction and avoid complications.\n",
        "\n",
        "– This is achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, and abstract methods that describe what a system can do but not how it does it. It's just seeing a car as one piece without having to understand what's inside its parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "• **Encapusation:**\n",
        "– Encapsulation focuses on bundling data and methods within a single object ensures that the data is not accessible or modifiable without properauthorization, thus maintaining its integrity and privacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "– Access modifiers such as public, private, andprotected control the visibility. It is similar to a capsule that keeps the medicine safe and protectsit from the environment.\n",

        "• Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods that are surrounded by double underscores, like this:- __method__. These methods allow you to define how instances of your classes behave when they are used with built-in Python functions or operators.\n",

        "• The reuse of code is inheritance's main goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "• Instead of starting from scratch when developing a new class, we can use the existing class instead of re-creating it from scratch. #synatx of inheritance class Baseclass: #body of Baseclass class Derivedclass(Baseclass): #body of Derivedclass.\n",

        "\n",
        "• In OOP, polymorphism refers to an object's capacity to assume several forms. Simplysaid, polymorphism enables us to carry out a single activity in a variety of ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "• From the Greek words poly (many) and morphism (forms), we get polymorphism. Polymorphism is the capacity to assume several shapes.\n",

        "• In python, polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and method overriding\n",

        "\n",
        "• A class's data members and methods can be made private or protected in order to achieve encapsulation. Direct access modifiers like public, private and protected don't exist in Python. Though Single and double underscores can be used to accomplish this.\n",
